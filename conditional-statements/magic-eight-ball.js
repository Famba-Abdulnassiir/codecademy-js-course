/*
Magic Eight Ball

You’ve learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! It’s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.

In this project we will build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.

let userName = '';

userName == 'Jane' ? console.log(`Hello ${userName}`) : console.log('Hello');

let userQuestion = 'What do you want to ask the Magic Eight Ball?';

console.log(`${userQuestion}`);

let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8);

eightBall = '';

switch(randomNumber){
  case 0:
    eightBall = 'It is certain';
    break;
  case 1:
    eightBall = 'It is decidedly so';
    break;

/*

Run your program a few times to see random results appear in the console!

If you want extra practice:

If you started with a switch statement, convert it to if/else if/else statements.
If you started with if/else if/else statements, convert them to a switch statement.
