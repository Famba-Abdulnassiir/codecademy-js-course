# CodeCademy Javascript Course

In this course, you will learn programming fundamentals with JavaScript syntax. The concepts covered in this course lay the foundation for using JavaScript in any environment.

### Welcome to Learn JavaScript

## What will you learn?
After this course, you will be able to:

- implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables
- use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript
- construct functions and pass data through them
- identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript
- use arrays to store lists of data
- use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times
- use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays
- use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items.

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.

## What will you create?
Throughout this course, you will be tasked with applying the concepts learned in projects. Here is a preview of some of the projects featured in this course:

- Kelvin Weather

Build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing variables and printing to the console to create a temperature convertor.

- Sleep Debt Calculator

Practice functions to help us build separation of concerns by building a calculator to tell us if we are getting enough sleep each week.

- Whale Talk
